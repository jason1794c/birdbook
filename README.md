# Birdbook
Birdbook is a website that is created to look like a replica of the social media website, Facebook. Upon visiting the website, the user will be prompted to sign in using their Google account. Authentication is conducted using Google's proprietary company, Firebase. Once the user signs in, they will be able to access the website's dashboard where they will see several posts from past users. This website has posting functionality where the user can post their thoughts and an optional image of their choice. In addition, the user can like/unlike posts that are displayed on the website.
